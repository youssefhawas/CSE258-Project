## PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project uses the last-fm (https://grouplens.org/datasets/hetrec-2011/) dataset to solve a machine learning classification task. The task at hand is, given a certain user and an artist, the model produced predicts whether that user likes that artist or not. It is essentially also a model that can be used as an artist recommender for users in the dataset.

## FILE STRUCTURE

- model_experiments.ipynb: This jupyter notebook contains some data analysis and visualization using matplotlib. It also then shows the results of different feature sets and trains models on said feature sets to determine which models and features work best.

- Project_Writeup.pdf: This report goes into more detail on the task and how it was tackled. As well as more in depth analysis of the task and the data used.

*This project was implemented as part of UCSD's CSE 258 course (Web Mining and Recommender Systems)*
